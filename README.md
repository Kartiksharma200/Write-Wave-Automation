# Manual Testing Approach

## The manual testing process includes:

Test Plan: Defines the testing scope, objectives, and methodology.

Test Scenarios: Identifies different functional and non-functional scenarios to test.

Test Cases: Documents detailed test steps, expected results, and actual results.

Bug Report: Logs issues found during testing with severity and steps to reproduce.

Test Summary Report: Summarizes the testing outcomes and overall quality assessment.

Test Mind Map: A visual representation of the testing strategy and coverage.

# Automation Testing Approach

The automation framework is built using Selenium with Java, following the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. It integrates best practices for maintainability and scalability, supporting TestNG for test execution and Maven for dependency management.

## Features

Page Object Model (POM): Enhances test maintainability by separating page elements and actions.

TestNG Integration: Facilitates structured test execution and reporting.

Maven for Dependency Management: Simplifies project setup and dependency handling.

Cross-Browser Testing: Ensures application functionality across different browsers.

Detailed Reporting: Generates comprehensive test execution reports.
